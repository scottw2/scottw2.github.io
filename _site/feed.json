            "content_text": "IntroductionHouse prices are constantly in the news. However, basically any news story I’ve read about house prices doesn’t really focus on very granular data - usually talking about the country overall, or dividing by region and perhaps doing a deep dive into a specific locality. The focus of the post is to look at house prices at a very local level, which 1) should hopefully show some interesting trends and 2) allows me to learn a bit about making interactive maps in R.DataThe data on house prices was taken from the April? or May release of the “Prices Paid” dataset, collected by HM Land Registry. This is a dataset of all registered property sales in England &amp; Wales from 1995 to present. It contains information on the price paid for each property as well as the postcode, address and other info (e.g. property type, new build/old build). Ideally, I wanted to get data for the whole of the UK, but Scotland does not provide this data in an easily accessible manner (as far as I know) and any property data for Northern Ireland apparently requires a paid license to access, so I was left with just English and Welsh data.To map this data, I needed to match the postcodes to geographic coordinates and geographic areas. I used the ONS National Postcode Lookup to do this. The Postcode Lookup details every postcode in the UK and their associated latitude/longitude as well as the geographic areas that they belong to (e.g. Local Authority District, Middle Super Output Area).Some other important datasets I needed for creating some of the maps were the shapefiles for the geographic areas I wanted to look at, which were also from the ONS.One final dataset is from the House of Commons (HoC) Library. For Middle Super Output Areas (MSOA) - which is an area type I wanted to visualise, they generally don’t have names and are just named based on their local authority district (e.g.Great Yarmouth 1, Great Yarmouth 2), however the HoC Library has devised actual descriptive names for these areas (e.g. Hemsby &amp; Oremsby, Fleggburgh/ Rollesby &amp; Martham), which are a bit nicer for presenting and analysing the data at a MSOA level.General MethodDue to reporting time lags, it’s generally not best practice to look at data from the last few months, so I only looked at data up to March 2022. This should hopefully reduce the impact of reporting lags, while also providing fairly up to date figures. Because I am drilling down into rather small areas, just using sales from say March 2022 would lead to a very small sample size for a lot of areas, which wouldn’t be very accurate. So I decided to look at the median price over the whole year for each area - March 2021 - March 2022. I didn’t adjust for property type mix as a lot of house price indexes do, instead opting to look at the unadjusted values.I also decided to bin the price/sale values, as I think it makes it easier to interpret the difference in price between areas. The bins I used were generally not equal width, but instead were somewhat similar to log scales, where larger values had larger bins, to reduce the total number of bins, while not crowding out the lower prices areas like a continuous legend would.I wanted to make the maps interactive, so I used the Leaflet package in R, which is build on top of the Leaflet JavaScript library. There are quite a lot of more advanced features and tricks in the Leaflet package that I tried to make the most of, e.g. adding dynamic lables, using multiple basemaps to show location labels on top of the polygon layers and having multiple polygon layers that are only visible at different zoom levels.Chloropleth mapsthe first maps type I looked at was a chloropleth, shown below. The map initially shows median house prices and the number of sales at a Local Authority District (LAD) Level of granularity. However if you zoom in, it will break the LADs down to MSOAs (essentially one layer below - ignoring wards as they don’t match perfectly). This allows you to get a broader and less crowded view at the national level and still explore regional variations at a high level of granularity.

Leaflet uses the “Web Mercator” coordinate referencing system (CRS) (3875) to display maps, which essentially flattens maps to make them look nice for the web. However, it does this at the expense of accurate distances, which get worse the further you move from the equator and the UK is quite far from the ecuator. This makes me question how accurate these grid square sizes are. It would probably be better to use a CRS like the UK National Grid (27700), which does not distort distances like the Web Mercator CRS, but leaflet doesn’t support this, atleast not if you want to use pretty basemaps.In any case, these grid squares be used to create quite detailed and cool maps of house prices and house sales. The main differences compared to chloropleth maps are that grid maps don’t say anything about population density/property density and because of this there are quite a lot of grid-squares with just a few observations, which may impact the reliability of median prices and could be misleading. At the same time, using equally sized grid-squares does allow for a more granular view of the actual house prices and sales across the country, which can reveal insight which may be hidden by using other map types. e.g. you can see a few grid squares with very highly priced properties but only 1 or 2 sales above Erith in the London map below.Below you can see maps of the UK, coloured firstly by property price and secondly by number of sales.        I also created a grid map just for London, as London has a high population (~8.9 million) and a whole bunch of regional inequalities. I therefore thought it would be interesting to visualise it individually. I also added a few more colours to the colour scale and legend to capture the very pricy areas of the Capital.    Point-grid mapsAdditionally, the st_centroid function can be used to find the centre of each grid-square. From this we can create what I’ve called “point-grid” maps (not sure if there is an actual name for this kind of map, but I have seen some other examples). These maps can use both colour and size scales to show both total sales and median price, which isn’t shown in the other maps here. The drawdown of this type of map is that it can become harder to see the individual points in high turnover area e.g. London or Birmingham, due to overlapping points.    ",

            "content_text": "IntroductionIn recent years, Twitter has become increasingly prominent in politics, not least due to ex-US President Donald Trump’s questionable use of the platform. But across the pond in the UK, politicians’ Twitter presences have been gradually growing over the years, as more MPs (and their teams) get online and start tweeting. Nowadays, with the majority of UK MPs on Twitter, there is an opportunity to gain insight into a number of areas, including MPs’ networks, political beliefs and public appeal. This insight can be gleamed from analysing MPs’ behaviour on the social network; from what they tweet, who they retweet, who they follow, who follows them etc…The area I would like to focus on in this blog post is the parliamentary twitter network as there is not a particularly large amount of research around this. A few previous reports and articles have shown than UK MPs generally tend to cluster together within their own parties, with regard to following relationships and also re-tweet networks (McLoughlin et al., 2019), (Sleeman, 2015), (Weaver et al., 2018). Although, events like the EU referendum have lead to more cross-party interaction in terms of at least tweeting behaviour (Weaver et al., 2018). However, most of this research is a number of years old and doesn’t really reflect the current parliament since the 2019 election. Moreover, the follower-following relationships of smaller parties (e.g. Lib Dems, SDLP, DUP) have not been looked at individually, as well as the within-party follower-following networks. So, in this post I am going to look at the follower-following relationships between UK MPs, with a focus on smaller parties’ overall networks and also on the within-party networks of the Labour and Conservative parties.DataThe data was gathered in February 2021 from Twitter’s API, using the Tweepy package in Python (as the data is from February, it doesn’t take into account any changes since then, e.g. Neale Hanvey &amp; Kenny MacAskill defecting from the SNP to the Alba party). I downloaded a spreadsheet from https://www.politics-social.com/ which contained each MP’s Twitter name, their party and their constituency. I then queried the API using Python to return a list of who each MP followed, along with their bio, follower count, like count, status count and a few other metrics. I ran into a few issues, e.g. some MPs had deleted their twitter accounts or had private profiles so I could not view their following list - so I removed those MPs from the dataset. As Twitter’s free API has limits on how much data you can download in a given period, it took over 10 hours for all the data to be collected. I then did a bit of data manipulation in Python and R to get the data into the correct format for analysis and visualisation. Python and R code available here.Outline of MP Follower-Following RelationshipsIn Table 1, I have arranged a number of summary statistics for each party. I have used median and Interquartile range (IQR) stats as there are a lot of outliers and the data is not normally distributed - you can see the distribution of the number of MP Followers for all parliamentarians in Figure 1. As previous research has shown, generally MPs’ following-followers relationships tend to mostly be to their own parties. This leads to the average MP followers statistic mostly reflecting the number of MPs on twitter for each party, although this relationship doesn’t really hold for some of the very small parties (see the below table). However, while the Conservatives have on average more MP followers (i.e. followers who are MPs), they actually have less median total followers than most other parties, including Labour and the SNP. The Green Party has the 4th highest average MP followers and by far the most average total followers, but that is obviously due to there being only one (popular) Green MP - Caroline Lucas. The SNP has a modest median total followers relative to the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems, possibly reflecting the geographic focus of the party. The Lib Dems have quite a high median total followers and low median MP followers. The other minor parties have fairly similar total followers and MP follower counts, apart from Sinn Féin, who have a relatively low average MP followers and high median total followers, and the SDLP, who have very high values for both stats.Table 1: Summary of parties’ twitter followingsAdditionally, the Tories and Labour have quite a high variability of total followers, as measured by IQR, compared to other parties. Table 1 also shows the MPs from each party with the highest MP and total followers. For example, looking at Labour, Keir Starmer has the most MP followers, but with just over 1 million total followers, he trails ex-leader Jeremy Corbyn by a wide margin.Figure 1: Distribution of MP Followers by PartyFurthermore, ranking MPs by their number of MP followers can show some interesting results (see Table 2 below). Firstly, the majority of the MPs most followed by other MPs are Tories, with senior leadership and ex-leadership figures taking the top spots of the ranking. The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, however, comes in 3rd, reflecting his apolitical role in parliament. The only other non-Tory MPs in the top 25 are three Labour MPs - Keir Starmer, Ed Miliband and Wes Streeting.Table 2: MPs followed by the most other MPsOne relationship, which I mentioned earlier and would like to expand on, is that while the Tories do on average have more MP followers than their Labour counterparts, Labour MPs on average have more total followers. This is visualised in Figure 2 (below). This seems to show that although the Conservatives are more linked to one another in terms of following relationships, they actually have a harder time getting follows from the general public compared to Labour. I suspect this is due to Twitter having a relatively left-wing user-base, combined with Labour MPs possibly having a stronger online presence. The distribution of MPs from other parties is also visible in the figure, with most of them clustered in the left hand side of the charts.",

The other minor parties have fairly similar total followers and MP follower counts, apart from Sinn Féin, who have a relatively low average MP followers and high median total followers, and the SDLP, who have very high values for both stats.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/images/uk-mp-twitter-network-analysis/table1.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Table 1: Summary of parties’ twitter followings</em></p><p>Additionally, the Tories and Labour have quite a high variability of total followers, as measured by IQR, compared to other parties. Table 1 also shows the MPs from each party with the highest MP and total followers. For example, looking at Labour, Keir Starmer has the most MP followers, but with just over 1 million total followers, he trails ex-leader Jeremy Corbyn by a wide margin.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/images/uk-mp-twitter-network-analysis/figure1.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Figure 1: Distribution of MP Followers by Party</em></p><p>Furthermore, ranking MPs by their number of MP followers can show some interesting results (see Table 2 below). Firstly, the majority of the MPs most followed by other MPs are Tories, with senior leadership and ex-leadership figures taking the top spots of the ranking. The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, however, comes in 3rd, reflecting his apolitical role in parliament. The only other non-Tory MPs in the top 25 are three Labour MPs - Keir Starmer, Ed Miliband and Wes Streeting.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/images/uk-mp-twitter-network-analysis/table2.png\" alt=\"\" /><em>Table 2: MPs followed by the most other MPs</em></p><p>One relationship, which I mentioned earlier and would like to expand on, is that while the Tories do on average have more MP followers than their Labour counterparts, Labour MPs on average have more total followers. This is visualised in Figure 2 (below). This seems to show that although the Conservatives are more linked to one another in terms of following relationships, they actually have a harder time getting follows from the general public compared to Labour. I suspect this is due to Twitter having a relatively left-wing user-base, combined with Labour MPs possibly having a stronger online presence. The distribution of MPs from other parties is also visible in the figure, with most of them clustered in the left hand side of the charts.</p>",
