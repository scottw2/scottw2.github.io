## Introduction

House prices are constantly in the news. However, basically any news story I've read about house prices doesn't really focus on very granular data - usually talking about the country overall, or dividing by region and perhaps doing a deep dive into a specific locality. The focus of the post is to look at house prices at a very local level, which 1) should hopefully show some interesting trends and 2) allows me to learn a bit about making interactive maps in R.
